  ## About me
  
"At the age of 14, I discovered my passion for programming in computer science class and gained my first experience with HTML. In 2019, I decided to catch up on my high school diploma and I am expected to complete it in October 2023. Through the challenging training at Neuefische, I was able to acquire knowledge in web development and want to enter professional life full-time from September onwards. In addition, starting from the summer semester of 2024, I want to study computer science alongside my job to deepen my knowledge and skills."
