## About Me

üëã Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub.

üõ† Background: My journey in tech started unconventionally but embodies my strongest trait: autodidactic learning. In 2019, I took a significant step by diving deep into web development and displayed not just adaptability but also a knack for purposeful, self-directed knowledge acquisition. Training intensively at Neuefische, I acquired both technical expertise and the skills to agilely execute complex web projects.

üìö Continuous Learning: While I'm passionate about creating and contributing here, I'm also gearing up for a part-time distance course in computer science to further enhance my skills. But remember, coding and contributing remain my prime focus!

ü§ñ Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB.

üíº Let's Collaborate: Always open to exciting projects and challenges. If you find something interesting in my repos or have collaboration ideas, feel free to reach out!
