## About Me

üëã Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub.

üåê My Journey:
My passion for web development stems from my lifelong curiosity and enthusiasm for learning new things. I decided to pursue my Abitur at Abendgymnasium Wien, a school that offers flexible and individualized learning opportunities for adults. This decision not only demonstrated my determination and adaptability, but also my ability to acquire knowledge on my own terms. I further enhanced my web development skills by completing an intensive training program at Neuefische, a school and pool for digital talent. There, I learned how to manage and execute complex web projects with agility, using the latest tools and methodologies in the industry.

ü§ñ Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB.
