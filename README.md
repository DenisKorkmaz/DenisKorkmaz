## About me
Already at the age of 14, I had the dream of learning programming and received good grades in computer science at school. Unfortunately, due to family circumstances, I couldn't pursue the traditional path of obtaining a high school diploma and studying computer science to become a programmer. Now, I am working on obtaining my high school diploma through self-study, which I am expected to complete later this year.

My original goal was to study computer science, but I have now decided to attend a bootcamp to quickly enter the workforce. Through my self-taught experiences, I have learned to independently research and acquire complex knowledge. Additionally, I have worked professionally while pursuing my diploma, which has allowed me to develop excellent time management skills. Independent learning and time management are important skills that a web developer should possess. Based on my past experiences, I am confident that I possess the necessary soft skills for a career in the IT industry.

I find the format of a bootcamp particularly exciting, as it provides an ideal learning environment and allows for significant skill development in a short amount of time. In contrast to traditional education, bootcamps offer the opportunity to immediately apply the learned material in a practical setting. I am confident that the bootcamp will provide me with the necessary hard skills.
